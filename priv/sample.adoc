== Document Structure

=== Headings and Sections

Document headings use the equals sign (=) syntax. The number of equals signs determines the heading level.

```
= Document Title (Level 0 - used once per document)
== Section (Level 1)
=== Subsection (Level 2)
==== Sub-subsection (Level 3)
===== Level 4
====== Level 5
```

[NOTE]
====
In your project, you use `= ` for the main title and `==`, `===`, `====` for sections, subsections, and sub-subsections.
====

=== Section Anchors

Add anchors to create cross-references:

```
[#ways-of-working]
=== Ways of Working
```

== Text Formatting

=== Bold Text

Use double asterisks for bold:

```
*This text is bold*
```

Result: *This text is bold*

=== Italic Text

Use single underscores for italic:

```
_This text is italic_
```

Result: _This text is italic_

=== Bold Italic

Use double underscores and double asterisks:

```
***bold and italic***
```

=== Monospace/Code

Use backticks for inline code:

```
`code snippet`
```

Result: `code snippet`

== Lists

=== Unordered Lists

Use hyphens or asterisks for unordered lists:

```
- First item
- Second item
- Third item
```

Result:

- First item
- Second item
- Third item

=== Nested Lists

Indent with additional hyphens:

```
- Parent item
  - Child item 1
  - Child item 2
- Another parent
```

Result:

- Parent item
  - Child item 1
  - Child item 2
- Another parent

=== Definition Lists

Create key-value pairs:

```
Term:: Definition of the term
Another Term:: Its definition
```

Result:

Term:: Definition of the term
Another Term:: Its definition

=== Ordered Lists

Use dots and numbers:

```
. First item
. Second item
. Third item
```

Result:

. First item
. Second item
. Third item

== Admonitions (Call-out Blocks)

```
NOTE: This is important information that readers should be aware of.
```

Result:

NOTE: This is important information that readers should be aware of.

=== TIP

Use for recommended approaches:

```
TIP: This type of block means that the approach presented is a recommended one.
```

Result:

TIP: This type of block means that the approach presented is a recommended one.

=== WARNING

Use for cautions and warnings:

```
WARNING: This type of block means that the approach presented is not a recommended one.
```

Result:

WARNING: This type of block means that the approach presented is not a recommended one.

```

Result:

IMPORTANT: This is critical information that must not be overlooked.

=== CAUTION

Use for potential hazards:

```

```

Result:

CAUTION: Exercise caution when proceeding with this action.

== Links and References

=== External Links

Create hyperlinks:

```
link:https://example.com[Link Text]
```

Result:

link:https://example.com[Link Text]

=== Cross-References

Reference sections within the document:

```
<<ways-of-working>>
```

This creates a link to the section with the anchor `[#ways-of-working]`.

=== Footnotes

Add notes at the bottom of the page:

```
This is some text.footnote:[https://example.com/resource]
```

== Images

=== Basic Image Inclusion

```
image::function-oriented-structure.svg[pdfwidth=60%,align="center"]
```

Options:
- `pdfwidth=60%` - controls width in PDF output
- `align="center"` - centers the image
- `alt="Alternative text"` - alt text for accessibility

== Tables

=== Basic Table

```
[cols="1,.^4", frame="none", grid="none"]
|===
| Column 1 | Column 2
| Data 1   | Data 2
|===
```

=== Table with Multiple Columns

```
[cols="1,2,1,1,1,2"]
|===
|Header 1 |Header 2 |Header 3 |Header 4 |Header 5 |Header 6
|Data 1   |Data 2   |Data 3   |Data 4   |Data 5   |Data 6
|===
```

=== Table Options

- `[cols="..."]` - defines column widths and alignment
  - `1` - equal width
  - `.^` - center alignment
  - `^` - center alignment
  - `<` - left alignment
  - `>` - right alignment
- `frame="none"` - removes outer border
- `grid="none"` - removes internal grid lines
- `frame="all"` - shows all borders

=== Combining Images and Text in Tables

Create resource blocks with QR codes:

```
[cols="1,.^4", frame="none", grid="none"]
|===
|qrcode:https://example.com[format="png", xdim=2]
|Find links to further reading and resources on:
https://example.com
|===
```

== Blocks

=== Delimited Blocks

==== Quote Blocks

```
[quote]
____
This is a quote block.
It can span multiple lines.
____
```

==== Literal Blocks

```
....
Literal text with preserving whitespace
    and indentation
....
```

==== Example Blocks

```
====
This is an example block.
====
```

Result:

====
This is an example block.
====

== Special Formatting

=== Line Breaks

Use the `[%hardbreaks]` option to preserve line breaks:

```
[%hardbreaks]
— PM: First line of dialogue
— Director: Second line of dialogue
```

Result:

[%hardbreaks]
— PM: First line of dialogue
— Director: Second line of dialogue

=== Document Attributes

Define and use attributes:

```
:author: Your Name
:revdate: 28.10.2025
:revnumber: v0.3
:title: Document Title
:subtitle: A subtitle
```

Use attributes with curly braces:

```
= {title}
{author}
```

=== Substitutions

Create semantic markup:

```
((keep the lights on))
```

This creates index terms and semantic markers.

== Mathematical Notation

=== Using STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Math)

Enable STEM processing in document header:

```
:stem: latexmath
```

Then use in your content:

```
stem:[# tasks in a month = \text{(}N-1\text{)} \cdot \frac{20}{\text{Cycle Time}}]
```

Result:

stem:[# tasks in a month = \text{(}N-1\text{)} \cdot \frac{20}{\text{Cycle Time}}]

Inline math:

```
stem:[\frac{5 incidents}{4 weeks} = 1.25]
```

Result:

stem:[\frac{5 incidents}{4 weeks} = 1.25]

== Includes and Modular Documents

=== Include Files

Include other AsciiDoc files:

```
include::source/front_matter/index.adoc[]
```

This includes the content of the specified file.

=== Conditional Includes

Conditionally include content:

```
include::optional_section.adoc[]
```

Comment out with `//`:

```
// include::about_dunya.adoc[]
```

== Comments

=== Single-line Comments

```
// This is a comment and won't appear in output
```

=== Multi-line Comments

```
////
This is a block comment.
It can span multiple lines.
Everything inside is hidden from output.
////
```

== Practical Examples from Your Project

=== Example 1: Section with Anchor and Content

```
[#company-characteristics]
=== Characteristics of the company that impact your role

The job title "engineering manager" (EM) can vary widely between companies.
In some, an EM might oversee a large team of 30+ people, while in others,
they may lead a small team and focus heavily on hands-on work.
```

=== Example 2: Numbered List with Bold Terms

```
. *Is it relevant and timely?* A good optimization target should address
  a current and pressing need. Prioritize improvements that tackle urgent
  issues over those that are merely desirable.

. *Is it measurable?* Without a way to track progress, it's impossible
  to know if your efforts are actually making a difference.
```

=== Example 3: Mixed Content Block

```
==== Industry

The industry might impose constraints that shape how the company operates.
For example, in the healthcare industry, both small startups and big
enterprises are subject to legislation and no matter the size, companies
have to go through the scrutiny of external audits.

image::industry-diagram.svg[pdfwidth=60%,align="center"]

Be aware of the industry constraints:

- Compliance requirements
- Regulatory deadlines
- Safety standards
```

=== Example 4: NOTE Block with Link

```
NOTE: We've found that documenting architectural decisions helps
establish common approaches. Look at
link:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/prescriptive-guidance/latest/architectural-decision-records/adr-process.html[Architecture Decision Records Process]
for practical steps.
```

=== Example 5: Complex Table with Nested Content

```
[cols="1,2,1,1,1,2"]
|===
|Aspect |Description |Pro |Con |Rating |Notes

|Performance
|How fast the system operates
|Improves user experience
|May require investment
|High
|Critical for user satisfaction
|===
```

== Tips and Best Practices from Your Project

* Use anchors (`[#anchor-name]`) extensively for cross-referencing
* Combine images with text for visual communication
* Use admonitions (NOTE, TIP, WARNING) to highlight important information
* Create semantic markup with `((term))` for index entries
* Include external resources with tables combining text and QR codes
* Use STEM notation for mathematical formulas
* Keep sections and subsections well-organized with consistent levels
* Comment out sections with `//` for work in progress
* Use includes to modularize large documents
* Apply consistent attribute usage across the document
